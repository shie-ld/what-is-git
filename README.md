<!-- ABOUT THE TUTORIAL -->
## About The Tutorial

This tutorial is aimed at providing you the knowledge of `source code management` and `version control` using `git`. You will not just merely learn about which commands to execute, but how git achieves the whole funda of version control.

I'll try to incorporate as many things as I can in simple English in it, but after reading this, if you want to learn more about git, then the best resources are [Git Bool](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) and [Git Reference](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), also the source of this tutorial. This tutorial will aid you in understanding all the git features listed there.


<!-- WHAT IS GIT? -->
## What is Git?
Git is a tool that helps you in `version control` and `source code management` of your project. But wait a minute :thinking:, what are these things. Say we have a directory which contain two files - `foo.txt`, being containing `Hello foo` and `bar.txt` being containing `Hello bar`, as part of a project. Let us say it as `version 1` of our project. So our `version 1` will look like something: 


**Version 1**

File | Content
--- | ---
`foo.txt` | `Hello foo`
`bar.txt` | `Hello bar`



Now let us edit our `foo.txt` file and change it's content from `Hello foo` to `Hello foo boo`, and leave `bar.txt` uneditied. And say this is our `version 2` of the project. So our `version 2` will look like:


**Version 2**

File | Content
--- | ---
`foo.txt` | `Hello foo boo`
`bar.txt` | `Hello bar`



So till now, we have successfully rolled out 2 versions of our project. But in `version 2` I do not like the content of `foo.txt` and I want to roll back to previous version. So what a `version control` and `source code management` tool like `git` does is to make this task **seamless and efficient** without neck in the pain and having to remember when we released a specified version, or maintaining a `todo list` for that.


Now consider a mammoth size project on which thousands of developers are working. So there should be a way to manage all that stuff, so as to maintain integrity of project and all the related data. Here `git` come to our rescue :smile:. `git` will take care of everything - from source code management to version control.

Now we have a brief idea about what `git` is. So let us dwell deep about how `git` acheives that and how can we use it into our projects :nerd_face:.






<!-- OUTLINE -->
## Outline

![outline](./images/outline.jpg)

<br />

Let's start with the `Remote Repository`. Suppose you are one of the members in the team working on a project.   It is where you send the changes made by you in the project to share with other people


### Here's why: ###
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others.
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like writing assignments.
* So this project *aims at taking input as a text file and generating a brand new handwritten pdf file from it*.


Of course, this project is highly documented for your convinience so that you can tweak it as you wish. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.



### Built With

* [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
* [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)





<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Grab a python3 distribution and run the source code with the help of jupyter notebook. Both of these get set up if you install anaconda distribution on your system.

<p align="center">
    **OR**
</P>

Just install any python3 distribution, install the dependencies and run `textwritten.py` in the `src` folder.


### Prerequisites

* path.py
* numpy
* Pillow

After installing anaconda, run in the `src` directory 
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
in your terminal to install all the required dependencies and modules. Else they get installed automatically if you run the ipython notebook.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/shie-ld/textwritten.git
```
2. Install required modules
```sh
cd src
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the ipython notebook in `src` folder 

Don't forget to put in the `INPUT_FILE` from which you want to generate pdf and resulting `OUTPUT_FILE` just above the `main()` function in the end of the notebook. . Check current directory and viola, you have generated the required pdf.

<p align="center">
    **OR**
</P>

3. Run the `textwritten.py` in the source folder with correct options and arguments.





<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
### Using Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
INPUT_FILE = 'infile.txt'
OUTPUT_FILE = 'outfile.pdf'

main()
```

### Using CommandLine:

```sh
OPTIONS
-i | --input : specify the input text file, required
-o | --output : specify the output pdf file, default is out.pdf
```


So practical usage will look like:
```sh
# cloning the repo in your machine
git clone https://github.com/shie-ld/textwritten.git

cd textwritten/src

pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 textwritten.py -i hello.txt -o output.pdf

```

And you are good to go:smile:
